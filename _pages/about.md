Hi there! I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at [University of Washington](https://cs.washington.edu/). 

Currently, I am lucky to be advised by Prof. [Simon Peter](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~simpeter/) and Prof. [Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/).

Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree from [University of Toronto](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/).

My research interests are in the broad area of computer systems. 

Recently, I have been working on managing power consumption of storage devices in data centers [[1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3655038.3665945)].
