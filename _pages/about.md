# About
Hi there! I am a fourth year undergraduate student at University of Toronto, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

Currently, I am lucky to work with Prof. [Eyal de Lara](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delara/) on profiling memory usage in [OpenJ9 JVM](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/).

Before that, I worked with Dr. [Zhen Jia](https://www.amazon.science/author/zhen-jia) and Prof. [Xin Jin](https://xinjin.github.io/) on optimizing FP16 Winograd convolution on Amazon Graviton-2 ARM many-core processor during my internship at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

My research interests are in the broad area of computer systems.
